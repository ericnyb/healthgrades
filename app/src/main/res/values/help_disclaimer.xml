<b>Disclaimer from the DOHMH (Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) website.</b><br/><br/>
<font color=\'red\'>The scores presented for recent inspections may not be final. Restaurants are entitled to a hearing to challenge
citations issued by the Department, and successful challenges may result in a change to the score and/or grade issued
at the time of the inspection. Some of the scores presented here may reflect inspection results that are being challenged but have not yet been adjudicated; the Department will
update the information if it changes. Because of revisions to the inspection scoring system, inspections before July 27, 2010 cannot be converted into letter grades.</font><br/>
