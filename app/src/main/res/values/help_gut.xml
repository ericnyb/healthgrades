</p>
<p>
The gut feeling is either OK (Green),MAYBE (Yellow) or NO(Red).<br/><br/>
There are several factors that go into the Gut Feeling, but the <b>last inspection</b> is given most weight.<br/><br/>
Some quick logic used:<br/>
A new restaurant never given a grade gets a MAYBE at best. If they have an initial score that would earn an A,
the Gut Feeling will still be a MAYBE. If the score is in the B range they will get a MAYBE, and if it would have earned a
C it gets a NO.<br/><br/>
If the last inspection score was in the A range, but the restaurant was closed by the DOHMH within the last year, or they had a C grade
within the last year, they will get a MAYBE. If neither of those is true it will get an OK<br/><br/>

If the last inspection score was in the B range they will get a MAYBE.<br/><br/>
